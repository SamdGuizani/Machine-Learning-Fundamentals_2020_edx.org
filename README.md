# Machine Learning Fundamentals
## MOOC edx.org - UCSanDiegoX [2020]

This course provides a thorough grounding in a wide range of machine learning methods, for classification, regression, conditional probability estimation, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.
- Taxonomy of prediction problems
- Nearest neighbor methods and families of distance functions
- Generalization: what it means; overfitting; selecting parameters using cross-validation
- Generative modeling for classification, especially using the multivariate Gaussian
- Linear regression and its variants
- Logistic regression
- Optimization: deriving stochastic gradient descent algorithms and testing convexity
- Linear classification using the support vector machine
- Nonlinear modeling using basis expansion and kernel methods
- Decision trees, boosting, and random forests
- Methods for flat and hierarchical clustering
- Principal component analysis
- Autoencoders, distributed representations, and deep learning

The repo contains notebooks and Python files associated with programming assignments and grading projects.
